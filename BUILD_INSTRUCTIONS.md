- **Permissions**: The app requires SMS reading permissions for transaction analysis
- **Testing**: Test SMS permissions on a real device (not emulator)
- **Signing**: For Play Store distribution, create a proper keystore and sign the APK
- **Development**: Uncomment server section in capacitor.config.ts for hot-reload during development

## File Configuration

- `capacitor.config.ts` - Configured for production builds (server section commented out)
- `android-manifest-permissions.xml` - Lists all required Android permissions
- All Capacitor dependencies are properly installed

## Troubleshooting

1. **SMS Plugin Issues**: Ensure you're testing on a real Android device
2. **Build Failures**: Run `npx cap sync` after any changes to web assets
3. **Permission Denied**: Check that all required permissions are in AndroidManifest.xml

The project is ready for APK generation!
